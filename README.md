# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-CNN
The aim is to detect the symptoms of the disease occurring in leaves in an accurate way.Once the captured image is pre-processed, the various properties of the plant leaf such as intensity, color and size are extracted and sent to SVM classifier with Back propagation Neural Network for classification. The experimental results obtained using 169 images have shown that the classification accuracy by ANN ranges between 88% and 92%.
